# HackPSU — Team Powerful

Dates: Oct 25 — Oct 26, 2025

Team: Team Powerful (Penn State Graduate Students)

---

Elevator pitch
---------------

Team Powerful designed an elegant, high-impact solution for HackPSU focused on delivering fast, reliable, and demonstrable value in 48 hours. Our submission combines practical engineering with a user-first demo that clearly communicates problem, solution, and measurable impact — the qualities judges look for in a winning hack.

What we built (concise)
------------------------

- Problem: Briefly describe the real-world problem you addressed (replace this with the project's exact problem statement).
- Solution: A concise sentence or two describing the deliverable your team built during the hackathon and the core benefit it provides.

Key features (sample layout — edit to match your project)
------------------------------------------------------

- Real-time data ingestion and processing pipeline (low latency)
- Lightweight model or algorithm for [task] (explain novelty, e.g., speed, accuracy, or cost saving)
- Polished demo UI / CLI that shows problem → solution in under 90 seconds
- Clear evaluation metrics and a short benchmark (e.g., latency, accuracy, cost)

Why this wins
-------------

Judges reward submissions that are: impactful, technically sound, clearly presented, and demo-ready. This README highlights the metrics, user story, and demo flow that make our hack compelling:

- Impact: Explain how your project helps users/businesses/communities. Quantify where possible.
- Technical novelty: Call out any clever engineering decisions or algorithms used.
- Demo readiness: A short, reproducible demo path so judges can experience the value quickly.

Demo (90-second script)
-----------------------

1. Start the app/service (one command).
2. Show the input (a simple example) and press run.
3. Display the output and the metric dashboard (latency, accuracy, cost).
4. Call out the key win — why this output matters.

Replace the placeholders below with your project's commands and example inputs.

Quick start (example placeholders)
---------------------------------

1. Install dependencies

   - If Python: create a venv and pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start the demo

   - Example: python demo.py --sample inputs/sample1.json

3. Open the UI (if included)

   - Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser

Architecture (high-level)
-------------------------

Include a small architecture diagram here or a short bullet list of components you built:

- Frontend: Lightweight React/Streamlit/Flask UI for the demo (if any)
- Backend: Fast API / Flask / Lambda function serving the core model or algorithm
- Data: In-memory or lightweight DB / flat-file for demo dataset
- Model/Logic: Brief note about the model/algorithm and any pre-processing

Evaluation & Benchmarks
-----------------------

Show a short table of metrics you measured during the hack (replace with your own numbers):

- Latency: 50 ms (p50) / 110 ms (p95)
- Accuracy / F1 / relevant metric: 92% / 0.89
- Cost: $0.02 per 1k requests (demo estimate)

Future work
-----------

- Production hardening (auth, rate limiting, monitoring)
- Add end-to-end tests and CI
- Expand dataset and run extended evaluation
- Improve UX for non-technical users

Assets & Submission notes
------------------------

- Attach screenshots, a short demo video link, and a slide deck here (add files to /assets or link to cloud storage).

How judges should run the demo (concise checklist)
-------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements
3. Run the start command and follow the 90-second demo script above

Notes for customization
-----------------------

This README is structured to be presentation-ready and persuasive. Replace the placeholders (commands, metrics, dataset, contact) with concrete project details so the README tells a complete, judge-friendly story.

Good luck at HackPSU — Team Powerful!
